# SIMGB
A simulation, kind of like dwarf fortress for the Gameboy and or the gameboy color.

## info
I am not sure where I want to go with this. I personally don't think I will make anything worth while, as my "modular" system, is nt very modular. each new species needs their own AI, and stuff. Not to mention that this runs VERY BAD on real hardware. I am going to probably cut out the plant echosystem alltogther in favor of performance.
